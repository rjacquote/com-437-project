Project Outline

I. Project Description
•	The application is designed to allow users to set a budget amount for different categories while displaying a running amount at the top of the screen. The design has been simplified from the original makeup to help with ease of use.

II. Problem addressing
•	Current budgeting applications restrains the user’s ability to estimate the end of month budget and compare it with their current spending. Surprising expenses can make following a budget plan challenging, and unexpected life outcomes can outright force people to reconsider their strategy mid-execution of the current plan. Allowing users the ability to measure the sum of all expenses during the month will help them to determine if they need to restrict their current spending until the end of the budget cycle or afford additional expenses. 

III. Platform
•	The application will be developed using Android 7.1.1 (Nougat) and Android studio API 25, and it is designed to have capabilities for both mobile devices and tablets. 

IV. Front/Back End Support
•	The application will utilize Java and XML with full front and back-end support during the development process. The program will undergo testing and debugging via Android Studio before implementation.
•	The development, process and changes are tracked through documentation, and records will be available to those with the need to know including the client. 
•	The platform will allow for future upgrades to application as deemed necessary by the client.

V. Functionality
•	The application will allow categories to add multiple transactions through a text window for each instance. Numerous tabs will show every individual transaction, and the current balance for the budget cycle will be displayed at the top of the screen. 
•	An option to input income, which will help users determine the allowable budget amount for the cycle, will become accessible to the user. 
•	Additional categories can be appended in the income and expenses sections for the cycle. 
•	A red dollar sign will denote an expense during input. 

VI. Design
•	The application will have a simple design with the following main categories:
o	Tabulated amount in the top
o	Transaction (positive or negative amount)
o	Transaction (positive or negative amount)
o	Input window
